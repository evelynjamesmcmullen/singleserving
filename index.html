  <p>A day in the capital of Denmark where you don't have to crowd around the little mermaid statue.</p>

 <h2> EAT </h2> 
  <h4>Something Millenial</h4>

  </figure>
 <p> 
   If you're in the mood for something quasi-healthy 
   and easy on the eyes, definitely head over to Atelier September on 
   Gothersgade 30. They have great coffee, and the Avocado toast- though a typical choice- gets major brownie points for its interesting ingredients, like lemon and chives. 
  </p>
  
  <h4> Something Traditional </h4>
  <figure>
  <img src="singleservingimg/plaice.jpg" alt="Smorrebrod" width="500" height="600">
  </figure>
  <p>
  Denmark is known for its smørrebrod, which are open-faced sandwiches stacked to the high heavens 
    with anything from shrimp and egg to chicken salad. For a true smørrebrod experience, 
    head over to Restaurant Schønnemann for a fried plaice smørrebrod (it's a norweigan fish and I know it sounds weird but once you try it with the remoulade you'll be in love)
    While you're at it- try the chicken tartelette too!
  </p>

  <h4> Something Quick but Still Bomb </h4>
  <figure>
  <img src="singleservingimg/cheese.jpg" alt="cheese and bread" width="500" height="600">
  </figure>
  <p> Baked fresh every day, Meyer's Bageri has the best bread I have ever had- and that is coming from a self-proclaimed bread connoisseur.
    They will give you a fresh bun with a cheese of your choice (try the gouda), and it is heavenly. </p>
  
  <h2> SHOP </h2>
  
  <h4> Weekday </h4> 
  <p> Weekday is a Swedish brand, but it has gained prominence in many of its neighboring Scandinavian countries, including Denmark. 
    They focus on cool minimalist streetwear, but also come out with some fun statement pieces as well. 
    The best part about it is that you can't purchase anything from them from the US, so nobody will jack your style :-) </p>
  <h4> Zara Home </h4>
  <p> We all know Zara, but what is Zara Home? The answer is a magical place that does not yet exist in the United States that includes any 
  piece of fun home decor that you could ever conjure up in your mind. I'm talking monocrhomatic cutlery, skull candles, 
    giant fur pillows, the works. </p>
  <h4> Monki </h4>
  <p> Another European Staple, Monki is like a scandinavian Forever 21, but more on-trend. We all know that somehow
    Europe is months ahead in fashion, and Monki is the perfect place to go if you want to stunt on em on a budget.</p>
  
 <h2> DO <h2>
   <h4> The Glyptotek </h4>
   <figure>
   <img src="singleservingimg/courtyard.jpg" alt="glyptotek" width="500" height="600">
     <figure>
   <p> Not your average art museum! The Glyptotek has a wide array of interesting art pieces and sculptures from around the world. The best part 
     of the experience is definitely going to the courtyard, where there is a lush landscape of plants paired with gorgeous marble statues. In the middle of the courtyard you can see a
     sculpture of a woman breastfeeding like 12 babies... so it's definitely interesting. </p>
       <figure>
   <img src=singleservingimg/statue.jpg" alt="statue" width="500" height="600">
                                                                              </figure>
   <h4> Freetown Christiania </h4>
   <img src="insert link" alt="Christiania">

   <p>Whether you smoke weed or not, Christiania is a very cool place to go. It's an independent "anarchist district", where it's residents don't live by the rules 
   of the EU or the Danish government. This has led it to be a popular spot to buy and sell Marijuana and Hash on 
   the long street that passes through, otherwise known as 'pusher street'. There are small art galleries around the area, leashless dogs, and very interesting people 
   with great stories. </p>
